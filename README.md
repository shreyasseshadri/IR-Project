# IR-Project


There are two drive folders consisting of two implementations
- Supervised-Bidaf  [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Muk4479jud5q6t1QnWQ3jyJcdavgBVsm?usp=sharing)
- Unsuperised-Word2vec+cosine similarity  [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1B2atatBhjQ1VQzPj1wqUHPm1L4c44nGb?usp=sharing)

## Instructions

### General Instructions
  - <b>This repository contains only the code it cannot can be directly run, to run the code, please use the drive link given above as that folder contains all the required data to run.</b> 
  - Change notebook settings to use GPU to get maximum performance.
 
 ### Unsupervised Method 
  - Locate `unsupervised.ipynb` in the folder for supervised method implementation of this approach.
  - It has three sections, which are
    - Pre Processing
    - Training Word2vec model
    - Cosine Similarity 
  - All data folders are already downloaded and setup in the folder.
  
 ### Supervised Bidaf
 - Locate `main.ipynb` in the folder for supervised method(given above) and execute it line by line.
 - Installation of required dependencies is already given in the cells, and just needs to be executed. 
 - It also uses the evaluation script given SqUAD, for evaluation of the predicions.
 - `Layers` folder consists of all the custom built Keras Layers.
